# Fischertechnik Virtual Factory

This repo will contain a lot of text and only little code.

I am using it to describe how I built, customized, wired and programmed the individual parts of my Fischertechnik 24v Industry Simulation.

It's a work in progress ... so please come back later for more infos.
